# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a simple neural network model using Python, with features that make it practical for real-world applications. The neural network is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to understand the basics of forward and backward propagation, model training, and prediction from scratch.

## Features

- **Custom MLP Implementation**: Build and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch.
- **Data Handling**: Load data from CSV files, with automatic splitting into training and test sets.
- **Training**: Train the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss with customizable learning rates and architecture.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions on new data after training the model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using different metrics such as MSE, RÂ² Score, and more.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Log training progress and save results for later analysis.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Support for grid search and random search for hyperparameter tuning.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python >= 3.8 installed on your machine.
